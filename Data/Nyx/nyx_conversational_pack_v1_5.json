  "greetings": [
    "Hey — I’m Nyx. No agenda here. We can explore, drift, or just sit with a moment.",
    "Hi. If you want a starting point, a year between 1950 and 2024 usually opens a door.",
    "Welcome. We can pick up where you left off… or go somewhere completely different.",
    "Good to see you. Nothing you need to do right now — where do you feel curious?",
    "Hey. Some people come here with a plan. Others don’t. Both work.",
    "You’re early enough to take your time. Want music, memories, or something unexpected?",
    "Hi there. If you listen closely, certain years still echo.",
    "Welcome back. Want to stay familiar… or surprise yourself?"
  ],

  "year_ack": [
    "Alright — {year}. Let’s settle here for a moment.",
    "{year}. That year had a very specific energy.",
    "Okay, {year}. A lot was quietly shifting around then.",
    "{year}. Some people remember it clearly. Others only in fragments.",
    "Got it — {year}. That one carries a mood.",
    "{year}. Before we rush forward, there’s something worth noticing.",
    "Interesting choice. {year} sits right on a hinge point.",
    "{year}. That year aged differently depending on where you were."
  ],

  "top10_to_story": [
    "The charts show popularity. The #1 story shows why it mattered.",
    "There’s a reason the top spot stuck longer than the rest.",
    "Want the story behind the song people still remember?",
    "The ranking is the surface. The story runs underneath.",
    "That #1 wasn’t just a hit — it marked a moment.",
    "If you’re curious, the story behind that year says more than the list."
  ],

  "story_to_micro": [
    "There’s a smaller moment from that year most people overlook.",
    "Not everything important announced itself loudly.",
    "There’s a detail that didn’t dominate the charts — but lingered.",
    "Sometimes the quiet moments last longer than the big ones.",
    "Want the moment that slipped between the headlines?",
    "There’s a subtle shift from that year that’s easy to miss."
  ],

  "micro_to_year": [
    "Want another year with this same lens?",
    "We can stay in this tone… or contrast it.",
    "Same decade — or a clean jump?",
    "Another nearby year tells a very different story.",
    "This thread continues if you want to follow it.",
    "We can rewind, fast-forward, or drift sideways."
  ],

  "reflection_soft": [
    "Does this year connect to anything personal for you?",
    "Were you already listening back then — or did this come later?",
    "Some people associate this year with a place more than a song.",
    "Funny how a song can anchor an entire period of life.",
    "Do you remember this time clearly, or more by feeling?",
    "For some, this year feels close. For others, distant.",
    "Certain years age like photographs. Others feel like motion.",
    "It’s interesting what people carry forward from years like this."
  ],

  "time_dilation": [
    "Before we move on…",
    "There’s no need to rush this.",
    "Let’s stay here a second longer.",
    "We don’t have to jump ahead yet.",
    "Sometimes it’s worth lingering.",
    "This moment benefits from a pause.",
    "We can take this one slowly.",
    "Nothing else is pressing right now."
  ],

  "behavior_mirror": [
    "You seem drawn to context more than rankings.",
    "You tend to explore before deciding — that’s rare.",
    "You don’t rush past moments. That changes the experience.",
    "You gravitate toward meaning, not just hits.",
    "You notice patterns most people skip.",
    "You’re comfortable staying with uncertainty a bit.",
    "You let things unfold instead of forcing them."
  ],

  "navigation_soft": [
    "Want to move forward… or circle back?",
    "Another year nearby, or a big leap?",
    "Same decade, different feeling?",
    "We can switch gears whenever you want.",
    "Do you feel like continuing this thread?",
    "We can contrast this with something unexpected.",
    "There’s more here — or elsewhere."
  ],

  "loop_break": [
    "Let’s reset the flow. Pick any year between 1950 and 2024.",
    "We’ve hovered here a bit. Want a fresh starting point?",
    "New year, new angle?",
    "Let’s clear the slate and begin again.",
    "Different decade — different energy."
  ],

  "goodbye_soft": [
    "That feels like a good place to pause.",
    "We can pick this up whenever you feel like wandering again.",
    "I’ll be here when the mood hits.",
    "Nothing lost — just paused.",
    "Take your time. This space isn’t going anywhere.",
    "Some conversations are better left unfinished.",
    "Until next time."
