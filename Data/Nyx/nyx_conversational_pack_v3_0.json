      "Continuity is based on conversation state, not user identity",
      "Never imply long-term memory unless explicitly available",
      "Offer re-entry paths that require zero explanation from the user",
      "Avoid repeating prompts; reference rhythm, not facts",
      "Treat pauses as natural, not failures",
      "Deep continuity language should feel like shared space, not stored history",
      "Statement-first only (no questions)",
      "No menu exposure in voice lines",
      "Long-form gravity only (no onboarding)"
