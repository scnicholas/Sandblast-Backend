    "Keep examples short and relatable (work, relationships, health, money, tech).",
    "Avoid diagnosis language; describe patterns, not labels.",
    "Avoid clinical claims, therapy framing, or prescriptive medical guidance.",
    "Prefer neutral, non-judgmental tone; respect user agency.",
    "Examples should be reusable across domains (psych, strategy, finance, cyber, law)."
